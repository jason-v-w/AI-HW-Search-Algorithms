This project contains four files specifying general functions that will be
used. All four should be loaded into a (Franz Inc. Allegro) Common Lisp
environment to make the required functions accessible.

(load "/YOUR_PATH/general_problem_framework.lisp")
(load "/YOUR_PATH/map_traversal_problem_description.lisp")
(load "/YOUR_PATH/search_framework.lisp")
(load "/YOUR_PATH/heap.lisp")

Once these are loaded, you can load the last file which contains the top level
code and a global variable defining the Romanian Holiday problem (finding a path
in Romania from an arbitrary starting city to Bucharest). It also contains code
that will be run to print 6 tables summarizing the performance of various
algorithms, so loading it will produce these tables.

(load "/YOUR_PATH/main.lisp")
